- The DutchX is a decentralized medium for the exchange of ERC-20 tokens.<br/>

- The process is governed by a smart contract; there is no intermediary between seller and bidders.
Trades happen directly peer-to-peer.<br/>

- Blockchain transactions are (likely) irreversible.
The wallet address and your transaction will be displayed permanently and publicly,
this inherent to services available on blockchain. The right to request rectification
or erasure of personal data is not possible with blockchain technology.<br/>

- You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of your wallet and private information.<br/>

- You are encouraged to save the web address (INSERT ADDRESS). Hacker imitation is a real risk!<br/>

- The DutchX as well as the Ethereum Protocol are still in an early development stage
and there is no guarantee of  an error-free process.<br/>

- ERC-20 tokens are not a currency in legal terms and are not backed by assets.
The value may be highly volatile. This volatility might cause unforeseen price fluctuations
as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.<br/>

- There is neither a price guarantee nor a liquidity guarantee on the DutchX. <br/>

- The availability of a token does not indicate approval or disapproval, volume or any other measure of quality.
Tokens may be added by anyone using the governing mechanisms of the smart contract
which is open source and available to all;
Token lists may be created by anyone and there is no approval or blacklisting process.<br/>

- You are prohibited from using or accessing DutchX to transmit or exchange digital assets
that are the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity,
including terrorism or tax evasion.<br/>

- In no event shall the initiator, programmer, auditor, auctioneer, participant or any other person
or entity which was/is involved in the creation of, maintenance of or any other form of interaction
or support of the DutchX be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential,
or exemplary damages of any kind arising out of or in any way related to the use of the DutchX,
regardless of the form of action, whether based in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory.<br/>

- You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the initiator, programmer, auditor, auctioneer, participant
or any other person or entity which is involved in the code maintenance
or other form of interaction with the DutchX from and against all claims, demands, actions, damages, losses,
costs, and expenses that arise from or relate to your responsibilities
under this Disclaimer or your violation of this Disclaimer. <br/>

- In case that your jurisdiction does not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental
or consequential damages you are prohibited to interact with the DutchX.<br/>

- You recognize and agree on using the DutchX on your own risk. <br/>

- You are legally allowed to buy/sell this kind of (new) asset class. <br/>
