        5. WHAT YOU REQUIRE TO USE OUR PLATFORM
                </strong>
      <div className="subText">
        5.1. Participants may use our Platform to interact with the Protocol and trade Supported Tokens against other Supported Tokens by placing their Supported Tokens via your Wallet into the next auction for that token pair running on the Protocol.
                  <br />

      <strong>
        6. NO FEES LEVIED BY US
                </strong>
      <div className="subText">
        6.1. We do not levy any fees on users of our Platform at this moment in time. This may however change in the future. Fees are incurred on the Protocol level and amount to a maximum of 0.5% of the tokens deposited with the Protocol by the user and are directly taken at the time of deposit. All the fees flow to the next auction of the same auction pair as an additional sell volume. Fees are not extracted from the Protocol.
                  <br />
        6.2. 50% of fees may be paid in OWL. OWL are generated by locking GNO Tokens, the native tokens of Gnosis Limited. Fees paid in OWL are consumed and do not go to any third party.
                  <br />
        6.3. The user has the ability to lower these fees based on a mechanism defined on Protocol level. The fees can be lowered to 0.
                  <br />
        6.4. Users interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain will incur network fees (so called gas costs). Gas costs are independent of the Platform and go to miners processing the transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain. We have no control over and do not set the gas costs, and do not benefit from them. Gas costs are calculated by multiplying the gas price with the gas used. The Platform does not change the default suggestion of your Wallet provider. Gas costs may differ significantly, depending on the ETH-USD rate and network usage at the transaction time. Users may be able to change the default gas price within their Wallet, depending on the Wallet used.

      <strong>
        RISKS
                </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      PRICE FLUCTUATIONS
                <br />
      ERC20 tokens are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by assets. The tokens’ value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.
              </p>
    <p>
      REGULATORY ACTION
                <br />
      We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Platform.
              </p>
    <p>
      LOW LIQUIDITY
                <br />
      Although trading bots provide minimum liquidity for the Supported Tokens, there is no assurance of an active or liquid trading market for the Supported Tokens. The Supported Tokens are not currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organisation, nor are they - unless stated otherwise - backed by any hard assets or other credit. There is therefore no guarantee as to market price or liquidity of the Supported Tokens. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that there will be a market for Supported Tokens, or that our Clearing Prices represent the market price.
                <br />
      <br />
      TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING
                <br />
      Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks. The availability of Supported Tokens on our Platform do not indicate our approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Supported Token, and must not replace your own understanding of the risks specific to each Supported Token.
              </p>
    <p>
      TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
                <br />
      Transactions on Ethereum Blockchain are generally immutable and irreversible. Any transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.
              </p>
    <p>
      THIRD PARTY DATA CENTRE FAILURES
                <br />
      Our Platform may in part be established on servers at data centre facilities of third party providers. We may be required to transfer our Platform to different facilities, and may incur service interruption in connection with such relocation. Data centre facilities are vulnerable to force majeure events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer breaches of security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change frequently and generally are not recognised until used against a target, it may not be possible to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
