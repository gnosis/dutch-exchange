      <h3>The DutchX in short</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          The DutchX is a fully decentralized exchange for ERC-20 token pairings, based on the Dutch auction principle.
          Using this interface, you will participate in the next running auction.
        </p>

    <section className="drawer" id="what-is-dutchx" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>What is the DutchX exactly?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          The DutchX is a decentralized, open trading protocol for ERC20 token pairs, based on the Dutch auction principle.
          Taking the traditional order book model to the blockchain makes little sense: problems such as front-running are magnified in discrete time.
          The mechanism of the DutchX is designed such that sellers deposit their tokens ahead of an auction.
          Then, the auction starts with a high price which falls until the market for the specific token-pair clears.
          Bidders submit their bids during the auction, but pay the <span className="underline">same</span> final price.
          Hence, the dominant strategy for bidders to reveal their true willingness to pay will result in fair market prices.
          Coupled with a pure on-chain design, the DutchX may function as a price oracle and is also usable for other smart contracts to exchange tokens.
          Participants benefit from the redistribution of fees within the DutchX ecosystem as well.

    <section className="drawer" id="how-dutch-auction-works" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>How does a Dutch auction work?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
        While there are some variations to the mechanism, the main concept of a Dutch auction is that it starts with a high but falling price.
        The first person to make a bid will purchase the auctioned item for the current price at the bidding time.
        If there are multiple fungible items in one auction (e.g. shares or tokens), then the auction only ends when all the items have been allocated to bidders. Each successful bidder will receive their purchase at the same final (lowest!) price.

    <section className="drawer" id="dutchx-characteristics" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>What are the specific characteristics of the DutchX?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          There is always only one auction for a particular pair (e.g. ETH-RDN) at any point in time.
          Taking part in the DutchX has a lot of advantages: you may reduce your fees, benefit from the fees of other participants, and you will get a fair price for tokens.
          However, it comes with the drawback of slower order execution!

    <section className="drawer" id="how-long-auction-takes" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>How long does an auction take?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          The duration of an auction is unknown ahead of time. However, a typical auction is expected to run for about 6 hours (in which the bidding to take place). After 6 hours, the auction reaches the prior closing price, which serves as an indication for length and price (the last available market price). Due to potential fluctuations (especially in the realm of cryptocurrencies), the auction may close earlier or run longer. It is important to stress that the auction price reflects the current fair market price.

    <section className="drawer" id="when-do-i-claim-tokens" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>When do I claim my tokens?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          Once you have placed the tokens that you want to sell in the auction (=submitted your deposit/order), you will take part in the next auction that runs. The next auction might start right away, or only in a couple of hours time if there is still an auction running for your chosen token pair. Once your auction has started, it might take around 6 hours to finish. Therefore, it could take some time until you can receive the tokens that you want for the trade (=claim your new tokens)—but it’s definitely worth the wait. You can be assured to get a fair price for your tokens.
          At the moment, there is no notification once your auction has closed, which means that you have to revisit this interface. A red claim button will alert you that you are able to claim your new tokens.

    <section className="drawer" id="how-do-i-claim-tokens" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>How do I claim my new tokens?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          The interface provides you with two options to claim your new tokens:
          The first option is on top of the page in Your Auctions. The red claim button shows the auctions for which you can claim tokens. If you claim your tokens via this feature, you will claim this particular token from all prior auctions you have participated in for that token pair (please note: you might need to sign two transactions with your wallet provider).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The second option is via the specific URL for the auction pair (auction overview page). You will automatically access the URL at the end of the order process. From there, you may claim the new token particular to that specific auction (you will only need to sign one transaction with your wallet provider).
          Note that you have to be connected to the same wallet that you used to participate in the auction in order to claim your new tokens! Please also check out the <Link to="#step-by-step-claiming">step-by-step guide</Link> about claiming tokens.

        <p>
        There is always only one auction for a particular pair (e.g. ETH-RDN) at any point in time.
        They start at least 10 minutes after the prior auction finish and only if the volume (i.e. deposit) of one of the auctions is worth more than 1,000 USD. Therefore, it is hard to estimate when exactly they will start as they depend on the prior auctions' closing time.

        <p>
          This is because your tokens are deposited into an auction. Only the auction clearing price will define how much tokens you are receiving. This is ideal for a fair price finding mechanism. An estimation of how many tokens you will receive based on the last auction closing price will be provided. Your (deposit) order is essentially a safely (slowly) executed market order.

          Once you have submitted your deposit and the next auction has started (you can see that an auction has started in the specific auction URL you were provided with after you submitted your deposit) and closed, you may proceed to claim your new tokens. At the moment, there is no notification of a closing auction, which means that you have to revisit this interface. A red claim button will alert you to claim your <i>Receive</i> token.
          <br/>
          The interface provides you with two different options to claim your new tokens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the top of the page in the section <i>“Your Auctions”</i>. Clicking the claim button in the <i>Your Auctions</i> section will claim the tokens from all prior auctions of that particular pair in which you have participated. Once clicked on the red claim button, you will see your wallet provider’s screens. You may need to confirm twice (this is to claim and withdraw back to your wallet).</li>
          <li>The second option is via the specific URL for the auction pair. You will automatically access the URL at the end of the deposit process. From there, you may claim the token particularly to that specific auction. You will only need to sign once.</li>

        <p><strong>Important: If your trade generated <Link to={URLS.TOKENS + '#what-is-mgn'}>Magnolia (MGN)</Link>, you will be credited those automatically upon claiming your new tokens. MGN are locked by default and are visible to you in the header bar of the interface.</strong></p>

          In case you participating in many auctions of the same pairing (e.g. one that is running, one that hasn’t started and one which has ended and you may claim), you will see only the amount for the currently running one (and a claim button for the one that has ended).

          The more Magnolia you hold as a percentage of the total Magnolia market volume, the lower is your fee (if within the relevant percentages). This provides an incentive to remain on the DutchX. Additionally, it pays off to be an active participant on the DutchX from the beginning, since the amount by which your fees are lowered depends on how much Magnolia you hold relative to the entire Magnolia market.

          <li>From this fee, you have the option to pay half in OWL (if you hold OWL in the wallet you are participating with). If you choose to pay half in OWL, this is 0.4A. 0.4A will be translated into USD, where 1 OWL is accepted as 1 USD on the DutchX.</li>

      <h3>DutchX</h3>
      <span>
      <p>The DutchX is a decentralized exchange for ERC20 token pairings, based on the Dutch auction principle. Taking the traditional order book model to the blockchain makes little sense: problems such as front-running are magnified in discrete time. The mechanism of the DutchX is designed such that sellers submit their tokens ahead of an auction. Then, the auction starts with a high price which falls until the market for the specific token-pairing clears. Bidders submit their bids during the auction, but pay the same final price. Hence, the dominant strategy for bidders to reveal their true willingness to pay will result in fair market prices. Coupled with a pure on-chain design, the DutchX may function as a price oracle and is also usable for other smart contracts to convert tokens. Participants benefit from the redistribution of fees within the DutchX ecosystem as well.

    </span>
    </section>

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="how-dutchx-works">
      <h3>How a Dutch auction works</h3>
      <span>
      <p>While there are some variations to the mechanism, the main concept of a Dutch auction is that it starts with a high but falling price. The first person to make a bid will purchase the auctioned item for the current price at the bidding time.
        If there are multiple fungible items in one auction (e.g. shares or tokens), then the auction only ends when all the items have been allocated to bidders and each successful bidder will receive their purchase at the same final (lowest!) price.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="what-is-batch-auction">
      <h3>What is a batch auction?</h3>
      <span>
      <p>Instead of trading continuously, the exchange collects the sell orders as batches until the auction starts, and clear them at the end of the auction all at once.<br/><br/>
        Therefore, by accumulating orders that are executed at the same time, a batch auction exchange not only represents a better price finding mechanism than an order book, but also eliminates the inherent flaw of the order book exchange: front-running.
        On the DutchX, your orders will get batched so that you benefit from these advantages (which is a reason for slow execution as well).

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="dutchx-in-detail">
      <h3>The DutchX in detail</h3>
      <span>
      <p>The DutchX for a particular token-pairing (e.g. exchange Token A for Token B) changes between two states: (i) before the particular auction starts, and (ii) when an auction is running.
        In the first state (i) sellers deposit their tokens (here: Token A). In the second state (ii), while the auction is running, bidders submit their bids (here: Token B).
        <br/><br/>
        (include seller/bidder picture from this slide deck, slide 6; I don’t think there is a separate graphic for this).
        <br/><br/>
        State (i) closes before state (ii) starts and hence sellers cannot deposit tokens into a running auction (these automatically go into the next auction). This means that there is a fixed amount of tokens to be auctioned off.
        <br/><br/>
        This is what the second state (the auction) looks like (Token A for Token B):
        (include picture of the running auction, slide 7, there should be a graph)
        <br/><br/>
        The price starts at a very high price point (twice the last closing price) and falls over time. The price falls quickly at first and slows down to decrease less rapidly. During the entire auction, bids are accepted. <strong>When the auction ends, all bidders pay the same closing price!</strong> The “price” is paid in the currency determined by the particular token-pairing. In this example, Token B was used to purchase A Token and the price is set by the exchange rate between Token A and Token B.

    </section>

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="auction-over-time">
      <h3>What does each auction look like over time?</h3>
      <span>
      <p>Only one auction of the same pairing is run at the same time. Note that opposite auctions (i.e. opposite auction of Token A as sellToken and Token B as bidToken is Token B as sellToken and Token A as bidToken) run at the same time (they start simultaneously and finishing at their individual times).<br/><br/>
        Of course for all unique pairings the same logic is applied and those auctions run independently from one another. Each pairing goes through the stages (i) sellers deposit, (ii) bidders bid, and (iii) payouts are claimed. Over time, it looks like this:

        <p>In theory, absolutely! MGN is an ERC20 token. However, please note that MGN are locked by default in order for you to make use of the fee reduction inherent to the DutchX. MGN are fungible and not personalized. At the moment, you won't be able to unlock your MGN on this interface. However, you will be in the next version of the DutchX.

          Ether (or "ETH")—the native currency built on the Ethereum blockchain—is not ERC20 compatible. <a href={URLS.WETH_TOKEN_URL} target="_blank">Wrapped Ether</a>, however, is Ether that is compliant with the ERC20 standard and hence can be traded on the DutchX.

          Yes! For a smooth user experience, the interface will wrap ETH for you in case you don't have any wrapped ETH available. In this case, wrapping your ETH is the first transaction you will have to approve before proceeding with the deposit.
          <br/>
          However, the <span className="underline">DutchX will not unwrap ETH for you—</span>if you exchange a token for ETH, you will always receive W-ETH.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="approve-choices-meaning">
      <h3>What does “approve this trade only” and “approve also for future trades” mean?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          This is a little technical and has to do with the fact that the DutchX operates on the blockchain.
          <br />
          If you choose "approve this trade only", you will approve for the DutchX to take the amount of the current trade out of your wallet. This also means that you will have to sign a transfer confirmation <span className="underline">and</span> an order confirmation for all future trades. You will spend transaction cost on each of these two separate transaction.
          <br />
          If you "approve also for future trades", you allow the DutchX to take this specific token for future trades as well. The DutchX won't take any tokens from your wallet until you confirm your order. You will use the same amount of funds, but you will save transaction costs on future trades because you will need to send fewer transactions to the blockchain going forward. In terms of transaction cost, this option is better for you. However, it carries the small risk that if the DutchX contract would be maliciously updated (there would always be a time lag and other safeguards in place), it could theoretically be re-designed to access more funds. This will certainly not happen, but every user should decide for themselves.
          <br />
          If you are unclear on this, please only approve the current trade.

      <h3>Why are exactly these tokens available on the interface?

        <p>The curation is based on tokens for which liquidity is provided for both sides of the market.

      <span>
        <p>This is the great thing about the DutchX—you don’t need any strategy. Simply deposit (sell) your token at any point in time. It will then be placed in the next running auction. The Dutch auction mechanism is designed to incentivize a fair price finding mechanism.</p>

      <span>
        <p>You do not know exactly how much of a token you will receive when you deposit your token— the interface will only show you an estimation based on the last auction outcome. Of course, prices may be volatile (up and down) and may change until your auction closes. However, at that point in time, it will be a fair price. To ensure that right incentives are set, we have implemented a few other safeguards beyond the mere auction design: 1) auctions only start once a threshold is reached to incentivize participation, 2) the market mechanisms applied have been explained to many market makers, 3) the tokens listed on this interface were curated based on minimal liquidity provision. This ensures that the seller always obtains at least a comparable market price as s/he would on an exchange (at auction closing time).

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="how-batch-auctions-are-applied">
      <h3>How does the DutchX apply batch auctions?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>Instead of trading continuously, the DutchX collects the sell orders as batches until the auction starts, and clears them at the end of the auction all at once.
          By accumulating orders that are executed at the same time, a batch auction not only represents a better price finding mechanism than an order book, but also eliminates the inherent flaw of the order book exchange: front-running.
          On the DutchX, your orders will get batched so that you benefit from these advantages. However, batching orders comes at the expense of speedy trading as the order execution time is slow.

        <p>For every transaction to the blockchain, you will incur gast costs. As an example: In order to trade a token (depositing and claiming back) it will be a total of about 175k gas. The total cost depends on the gas price you set. At 10Gwei (and an assumed ETH-USD rate of 400), this would equal 0.70 USD.</p>

        <p>No, not really—the mechanism of the DutchX is to batch orders and execute them at the same clearing price. What could happen with a lower gas price is that your order then gets submitted to the subsequent auction—but the logic here is the same! Hence, the only consequence would be that claiming your new tokens will get delayed. Also note that the processing of transactions takes time, hence you might need to wait longer until your order has gone through.</p>

Possible explanations include (but are not limited to): (1) you did not have sufficient ETH to pay for your gas costs, or (2) the gas price you had set was too low and thus the transaction was not mined.
