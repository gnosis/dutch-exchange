      <h3>What is slow.trade</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          Slow.trade is a graphical interface and trading platform (the "<strong>Platform</strong>"), that lets you seamlessly interact with the DutchX Decentralized Trading Protocol (the "<strong>DutchX Protocol</strong>").
        </p>
        <a href={dutchXSlowtrade} target="_blank"><img src={dutchXSlowtrade} /></a>

    <section className="drawer" id="what-is-dutchx" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>What is the DutchX then?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          The DutchX is a <strong>decentralized, open trading protocol</strong> for ERC20 token pairs (the "DutchX Protocol"). Using slow.trade, you will participate in the next running auction of the DutchX Protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is different from other protocols or trading platforms because it uses the Dutch auction mechanism instead of an order book. This mechanism brings several benefits including the <strong>same price for all auction participants</strong>, the ability to trade in markets with low liquidity and protections against frontrunning by high frequency traders, the trading platform itself or miners, and a lot more!
        </p>
        <p>
          The DutchX is not only a trading protocol, but also <strong>open source protocol that</strong> anyone can build on.

    <section className="drawer" id="why-slow-but-fair" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>Why slow but fair?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          Going through the <strong>auction process</strong> simply takes time.
          A slower trading time frame ensures that there is sufficient time to collect a critical threshold amount of token deposits (ideal for low liquidity tokens!) and that the <strong>important market mechanisms</strong> function properly.
        </p>
      </span>
    </section>

    <section className="drawer" id="will-i-get-a-fair-price" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>Will I get a fair price?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          Yes!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are market economics at work to ensure this. But to put your mind at ease:
          all token trades on slow.trade will get a comparable price to other trading
          platforms, if not a better one.

      <h3>Can I test it first?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
        Yes, absolutely! The DutchX Protocol has an alternative interface available on the Rinkeby Testnet: <a href={`https://${URLS.APP_URL_RINKEBY}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DutchX Interface</a>. This allows you to interact with the DutchX Rinkeby Protocol. To do so, make sure your Metamask is set to Rinkeby.

    <section className="drawer" id="how-long-auction-takes" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>How long does an auction take?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          A typical auction is expected to run for about<strong> 6 hours</strong>. After 6 hours, the auction reaches the prior closing price, which serves as an indication for length and price (the last available market price). Due to potential price fluctuations, which can often be quite significant in the cryptocurrency space, <strong>the auction may close earlier or run longer.</strong>

      <h3>When do I claim my tokens?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
        Once you have placed the tokens that you want to sell in the auction by submitting your deposit, you will take part in the next auction that runs. The next auction might start right away, or in a couple of hours time if there is still an auction running for your chosen token pair. Once your auction has started, <strong>it will take around 6 hours to finish. After the auction has come to a close, you can claim your tokens</strong>. A red claim button will alert you that you are able to claim your new tokens.

    <section className="drawer" id="how-do-i-claim-tokens" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>How do I claim my new tokens?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
        Slow.trade provides you with two options to claim your new tokens:
        </p>
        <p>
        The first option is on <strong>top of the page in <em>Your Auctions</em></strong>. The red claim button shows the auctions for which you can claim tokens. If you claim your tokens via this feature, you will claim this particular token from <em>all</em> prior auctions you have participated in for that token pair (please note: you might need to sign two transactions with your Wallet provider).
        </p><br />
        <p>
        The second option is <strong>via the specific URL for the auction pair (auction overview page)</strong>. You will automatically be directed to this URL at the end of the order process. From there, you may claim the new token particular to that specific auction. Accordingly, you will only need to sign one transaction with your Wallet provider.
        </p><br />
        <p>
        Note that you have to be connected to the same Wallet that you used to participate in the auction in order to claim your new tokens! Please also check out the <Link to="#step-by-step-claiming">step-by-step guide</Link> to claim tokens.

    <section className="drawer" id="when-auctions-start" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>When do auctions start?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
        There is no set schedule for the auctions. However, there will never  be more than one auction running for a particular trading pair (e.g. ETH-RDN, RDN-ETH) at any point in time. They start <strong>at least 10 minutes after the last of the auction pair has finished</strong> and only if the sell volume (i.e. deposit) of one of the auction pairs is worth at least 1,000 USD. For this reason, the time of the auction depends on the prior auctions' closing time.
        </p>
      </span>
    </section>

    <section className="drawer" id="when-auctions-end" onClick={handleClick}>
      <h3>When do auctions end?</h3>
      <span>
      <strong>Auctions end when all deposits (<i>sellTokens</i>) have been bought</strong> and have subsequently been allocated to bidders at the auction clearing price. The auction clearing price is the price that all <i>sellTokens</i> are traded at (i.e. clearing price * <i>bidVolume</i> = <i>sellVolume</i>).

                Wrapping ETH will be the first confirmation which you will see, but only if you need to wrap ETH (i.e. to make it ERC20 compatible). Please always confirm with your Wallet provider.

        <p>
          <strong>This is because your tokens are deposited into an auction.</strong> Only the auction clearing price will define how much tokens you are receiving.

        Once you have submitted your deposit and the auction round you participated in has closed, you may proceed to claim your new tokens. A red claim button will alert you on slow.trade that you can claim your <em>Receive</em> token. You should therefore revisit slow.trade frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
        Slow.trade provides you with <strong>two different options to claim your new tokens</strong>:
        </p><ul>

        <li>At the top of the page in the section <em>"Your Auctions"</em>. <strong>Clicking the claim button in the <em>Your Auctions </em>section</strong> will claim the tokens from all prior auctions of that particular pair in which you have participated and have not yet claimed. Once you have clicked on the red claim button, you will see your Wallet provider's screens. You may need to confirm twice to claim the tokens (the first confirmation is to claim and the second is to withdraw the tokens back into your Wallet).</li>
        <li>The second option is <strong>via the specific URL for the auction pair. You will automatically access the URL at the end of the deposit process.</strong> From there, you may claim the token that are particular to that specific auction. You will only need to sign once.</li></ul>

        <p>
        Important: If your trade generated <Link to={URLS.TOKENS + '#what-is-mgn'}>Magnolia (MGN)</Link>, they will be credited to your Wallet automatically upon claiming your new tokens. MGN are locked by default and are visible to you in the header bar of slow.trade.
        </p>

      <span>

        <p>
          <strong>Magnolia (MGN) is the fee reduction token for the DutchX</strong> <strong>Protocol</strong>. Magnolia reduce your fee level. One MGN is automatically created for every trade you make that is worth one ETH (or any fraction thereof). You will receive them automatically upon claiming your new tokens. The more you trade, the more MGN you will receive, and the lower your fee.
          </p>

          For more info, check out the section on <Link to={URLS.TOKENS + '#what-is-mgn'}>Magnolia</Link>.
          </p>
          <p>
          In the header bar of slow.trade, the amount of locked MGN associated with your linked Wallet is displayed. However, you will not see this amount in your Wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
          Of course, you do not need to hold any MGN to participate on slow.trade or the DutchX Protocol!

Fees normally start at 0.5% of the trading volume, and are gradually reduced depending on the amount of MGN you hold. Additionally, fees are not paid to us but paid into the next auction running for the respective auction pair and are thus redistributed to the users of the DutchX Protocol!

          Whitelisted tokens are those that generate Magnolia when traded in a whitelisted pair. A whitelisted pair simply means that both tokens that are in the auction are whitelisted tokens. The idea of whitelisted tokens is that no token can be added to the DutchX Protocol with the mere intention to create Magnolia and benefit from lower fees.

          Fee level is one of the most interesting aspects of the DutchX Protocol. If you hold enough Magnolia (MGN), your fee is 0. Fees normally start at 0.5% of your trading volume, and are gradually reduced depending on the amount of MGN you hold. <strong>Fees paid are redistributed to all users of the DutchX Protocol! </strong>

      <span>
        <p>
          Your fees will be lowered automatically if you hold <Link to={URLS.TOKENS + '#what-is-mgn'}>Magnolia</Link> tokens. The amount by which the fees are lowered depends on how much Magnolia you hold in relation to the entire Magnolia market volume. It is based on this step function integrated within the DutchX Protocol:

        <p>
          Currently no token is whitelisted to generate Magnolia and no Magnolia tokens are in circulation. When the DutchX smart contracts are released again by a decentralized autonomous organisation (a DAO), the Magnolia fee reduction will be activated. We have kept the explanatory notes for you to learn about this mechanism.
        <br />
          Note that the absence of Magnolia does not impact the <strong>fee redistribution, which is fully functioning.</strong> All fees remain within the DutchX Protocol and go to all its users.

      <h3>How do I obtain Magnolia (MGN)?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          You may either generate Magnolia (MGN) by trading on the DutchX Protocol (with a whitelisted trading pair),for example via slow.trade. You will get 1 MGN for every 1ETH worth of volume traded. For more info, see the section on <Link to={URLS.TOKENS + '#what-is-mgn'}>Magnolia</Link> (MGN).
        <br />
          Alternatively, you may purchase MGN as they are freely tradable. This may be particularly useful if you are close to the next fee reduction level.

        <p>
          To trade MGN, you must unlock them first. After a waiting period of 24 hours, they may be traded. Unlocked MGN may be locked again to immediately make use of the fee reduction. Currently, it is not possible to trade MGN on slow.trade.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="why-hold-mgn">
      <h3>Why is it beneficial to hold a lot of Magnolia (MGN)?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Magnolia</strong> (MGN) tokens <strong>reduce your fees</strong>.The more MGN you hold as a percentage of the total MGN market volume, the lower your fee is (if within the relevant percentages). This provides an incentive to continue trading on the DutchX Protocol. Additionally, it is beneficial to be an active participant on the DutchX Protocol from the beginning, since the amount by which your fees are lowered depends on how much MGN you hold relative to the entire MGN market.

          OWL gives the <a href={URLS.GNO_TOKEN_ETHERSCAN_URL} target="_blank">GNO token</a> its utility: it is generated by locking GNO and may be used on some applications created or run by Gnosis to pay for fees.

          OWL is not needed to use slow.trade or the DutchX Protocol.

          You can <strong>pay for half of the fees</strong> in OWL. You will be prompted to pay fees in OWL in case you have OWL available in your Wallet. The other half of the fees, however, always has to be covered in the token you are depositing for trade.

        <p>
          First, if you are a GNO holder, you obtain OWL by locking your GNO. Second, 1 OWL can be used to pay 1 USD worth of fees (this is fixed on the DutchX Protocol). Third, it is likely cheaper as OWL may be obtained for less than 1 USD.

          Slow.trade will prompt you automatically during the trading process and ask if you would like to use OWL to pay for fees. In case you approve, your selection will be valid for further transactions. If you do not approve, OWL will not be used to pay for your fees and you will be prompted again the next time.
        <br />
          Note that you might not be prompted because you have no OWL in your Wallet! To create a better user experience for you on slow.trade, you are only prompted if you have OWL in your connected Wallet.

          <li>The DutchX Protocol calculates your fee level based on the MGN you hold. Let’s assume your fee level is currently 0.4%. This information is displayed in the header bar.</li>
          <li>You then owe 0.08 A tokens in fees.</li>
          <li>From this fee, you have the option to pay half in OWL (if you hold OWL in the Wallet you are participating with). If you choose to pay half in OWL, this is 0.04 A tokens. 0.04 A tokens will be translated into USD, where 1 OWL is accepted as 1 USD on the DutchX Protocol.</li>
          <li>
            The remainder of the fees is paid in token A
            <ul>
              <li>In the case of paying with OWL, the remainder is 0.08-0.04 = 0.04 A tokens.</li>
              <li>In the case of not paying in OWL; the remainder is 0.08-0 = 0.08 A tokens.</li>

          Yes. For all transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain, gas has to be paid. The amount of gas that has to be paid depends on the transaction processed on Ethereum. Gas is needed to execute your order and claim your new tokens. Your Wallet provider will provide you with a gas estimate for each transaction, and you may also choose to specify a gas price.

      <h3>DutchX</h3>
      <span>
        <p>The DutchX is a decentralized exchange for ERC20 token pairings, based on the Dutch auction principle. Taking the traditional order book model to the blockchain makes little sense: problems such as front-running are magnified in discrete time. The mechanism of the DutchX is designed such that sellers submit their tokens ahead of an auction. Then, the auction starts with a high price which falls until the market for the specific token-pairing clears. Bidders submit their bids during the auction, but pay the same final price. Hence, the dominant strategy for bidders to reveal their true willingness to pay will result in fair market prices. Coupled with a pure on-chain design, the DutchX may function as a price oracle and is also usable for other smart contracts to convert tokens. Participants benefit from the redistribution of fees within the DutchX ecosystem as well.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="how-dutchx-works">
      <h3>How a Dutch auction works</h3>
      <span>
        <p>While there are some variations to the mechanism, the main concept of a Dutch auction is that it starts with a high but falling price. The first person to make a bid will purchase the auctioned item for the current price at the bidding time.
          If there are multiple fungible items in one auction (e.g. shares or tokens), then the auction only ends when all the items have been allocated to bidders and each successful bidder will receive their purchase at the same final (lowest!) price.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="what-is-batch-auction">
      <h3>What is a batch auction?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>Instead of trading continuously, the exchange collects the sell orders as batches until the auction starts, and clear them at the end of the auction all at once.<br /><br />
          Therefore, by accumulating orders that are executed at the same time, a batch auction exchange not only represents a better price finding mechanism than an order book, but also eliminates the inherent flaw of the order book exchange: front-running.
          On the DutchX, your orders will get batched so that you benefit from these advantages (which is a reason for slow execution as well).

      <h3>The DutchX in detail</h3>
      <span>
        <p>The DutchX for a particular token-pairing (e.g. exchange Token A for Token B) changes between two states: (i) before the particular auction starts, and (ii) when an auction is running.
          In the first state (i) sellers deposit their tokens (here: Token A). In the second state (ii), while the auction is running, bidders submit their bids (here: Token B).
        <br /><br />
          (include seller/bidder picture from this slide deck, slide 6; I don’t think there is a separate graphic for this).
        <br /><br />
          State (i) closes before state (ii) starts and hence sellers cannot deposit tokens into a running auction (these automatically go into the next auction). This means that there is a fixed amount of tokens to be auctioned off.
        <br /><br />
          This is what the second state (the auction) looks like (Token A for Token B):
          (include picture of the running auction, slide 7, there should be a graph)
        <br /><br />
          The price starts at a very high price point (twice the last closing price) and falls over time. The price falls quickly at first and slows down to decrease less rapidly. During the entire auction, bids are accepted. <strong>When the auction ends, all bidders pay the same closing price!</strong> The “price” is paid in the currency determined by the particular token-pairing. In this example, Token B was used to purchase A Token and the price is set by the exchange rate between Token A and Token B.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="auction-over-time">

Note that opposite auctions (i.e. opposite auction of Token A as sellToken and Token B as bidToken is Token B as sellToken and Token A as bidToken) run at the same time (they start simultaneously and finishing at their individual times).<br /><br />
          Of course for all unique pairings the same logic is applied and those auctions run independently from one another. Each pairing goes through the stages (i) sellers deposit, (ii) bidders bid, and (iii) payouts are claimed. Over time, it looks like this:

      <h3>Can I trade both Ether and wrapped Ether?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          Yes! For a smooth user experience, the interface will wrap ETH for you in case you don't have any wrapped ETH available. In this case, wrapping your ETH is the first transaction you will have to approve before proceeding with the deposit.
          <br />
          However, slow.trade <strong>will not unwrap ETH for you</strong>: If you trade a token for ETH, you will always receive W-ETH.

    <section className="drawer" onClick={handleClick} id="approve-choices-meaning">
      <h3>What does "approve this trade only" and "approve also for future trades" mean?</h3>
      <span>
        <p>
          This is a little technical and has to do with the fact that the DutchX Protocol operates on the Ethereum Blockchain.
          <br />
          If you choose <strong>"approve this trade only", you will approve for the DutchX Protocol to take the amount of the current trade from your Wallet</strong>. This also means that you will have to sign a transfer confirmation <strong>and</strong> an order confirmation for all future trades. You will spend transaction cost on each of these two separate transaction.
          <br />
          If you <strong>"approve also for future trades", you allow the DutchX Protocol to take this specific token for future trades as well.</strong> The DutchX Protocol won't take any tokens from your Wallet until you confirm your order. You will use the same amount of funds, but you will save transaction costs on future trades because you will need to send fewer transactions to the Ethereum Blockchain going forward. This option is cheaper in terms of overall transaction costs. However, it carries the risk that if the DutchX Protocol would be maliciously updated, it could theoretically be re-designed to access more funds. This is unlikely to happen, but every user should decide for themselves. We do not provide any guarantees.
          <br />
          If you are in doubt, please only approve the current trade.

          It is expected that a<strong> minimal liquidity is guaranteed.</strong> Apart from that, there must be no regulatory hurdle following our assessment.

          This is the great thing about the DutchX Protocol—<strong>you don't need a strategy.</strong> Simply deposit (sell) your token at any point in time. It will then be placed in the next running auction. The Dutch auction mechanism is designed to ensure a fair price finding mechanism.

          You do not know exactly how many tokens you will receive when you make your deposit — our interface will only show you an estimation based on the last auction outcome for the same token pair. Of course, prices are often volatile and may change during the auction. However, at that point in time, it will be a fair price. To ensure that the right incentives are set, we have implemented a few other safeguards beyond the mere auction design: 1) auctions only start once a threshold is reached to incentivize participation, 2) the market mechanisms applied have been explained to many market makers, 3) the supported tokens listed on this interface were curated based on minimal liquidity provision. This ensures that the seller always obtains at least a comparable market price as s/he would on other trading platforms (at auction closing time).

      <span>
        <p>
          While there are some variations to the mechanism, the main concept of a Dutch auction is that it starts with a high price that gradually decreases. The first person to make a bid will purchase the auctioned item for the current price at the bidding time.
        <br />
          If there are multiple assets in one auction (e.g. shares or tokens), the auction will only end when all the items have been allocated to participating bidders. <strong>Each successful bidder will receive their purchase at the same final (lowest) price.</strong>

        <p>
          Instead of trading continuously, t<strong>he DutchX Protocol collects the sell orders as batches until the auction starts, and clears them at the end of the auction all at once.</strong>
          <br />
          By accumulating orders that are executed at the same time, a batch auction not only represents a better price finding mechanism than an order book, but also eliminates the inherent flaw of the order book exchange: front-running. However, batching orders comes at the expense of speedy trading as order execution time is slow.
          <br />

          No, not really—the mechanism of the DutchX Protocol is to batch orders and execute them at the same clearing price. With a lower gas price, your order might miss the cut-off of one auction start (if it is just about to start) and will consequently be deposited into the following auction (you can never deposit into a running auction)—but the logic in that auction is the same! You may then have to wait longer to finalise your trade. In other words, the only consequence would be that claiming your new tokens will get delayed. Moreover, the processing of transactions takes time, so you might need to wait longer until your order has gone through.

          If a transaction fails, usually your Wallet provider will tell you what happened. These errors will relate to the nature of the Ethereum Blockchain. Possible explanations include (but are not limited to): (1) you did not have sufficient ETH to pay for your gas costs, or (2) the gas price you had set was too low and thus the transaction was not mined.

This feed is derived from the <a href="https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakerDAO</a> on-chain price feed (which is a median of many price feeds).
